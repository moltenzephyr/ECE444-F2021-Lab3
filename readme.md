As a current University of Toronto student, (if I was using Education Pathways to plan my upper-year courses) one functional requirement of the system I would like to improve is adding the ability to sort and/or filter the list of courses by their prerequisites. I would like this improvement so that I could immediately and clearly understand exactly which courses I would be permitted to take (i.e., I would like for it to only display those courses whose prerequisites I have fulfilled). With this prerequisite-focused feature, it would be immediately clear which courses I could choose from for my next semester of study directly from within Education Pathways. In its current implementation, I would only being able to get such a list if I track the courses that I am permitted to take using an external method (e.g., using an Excel spreadsheet, taking notes of which courses whose prerequisites I have fulfilled, etc.).

As a current University of Toronto student, a non-functional requirement that I would like to improve is Education Pathways’ usability. It currently contains detailed information about each course, such as the course’s prerequisites, but the user must click into the course details (e.g., by clicking on the course code) to see this information. With this current user interface, it is difficult to quickly compare the details (such as prerequisites) between courses since the details are not all shown on one page. To improve Education Pathways’ usability, I would either: 1) add a customizable field to the “search result” view that allows users to customize which detailed course data they would like to have displayed directly within the “search result” view or 2) add a feature to be able to select courses while in the “search result” view and then compare them in a separate “compare courses” view. This “compare courses” view would list out all of the characteristics about courses that users selected so that they can choose the characteristic that they are interested in and directly compare courses based off of any desired characteristics.
